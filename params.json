By modeling the generative process by which reads are produced from isoforms in RNA-Seq, the MISO model uses Bayesian inference to compute the probability that a read originated from a particular isoform.\r\n\r\nThe MISO framework is described in Katz et. al. [Analysis and design of RNA sequencing experiments for identifying isoform regulation](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v7/n12/full/nmeth.1528.html). Nature Methods (2010).\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nFor the full documentation, please see:\r\n\r\n[MISO manual](http://genes.mit.edu/burgelab/miso/docs/)\r\n\r\nAlso available on readthedocs.org: [miso.readthedocs.org](http://miso.readthedocs.org)","google":""}
